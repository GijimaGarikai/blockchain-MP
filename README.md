### Overview
This blockchain project implements a basic blockchain system in Java, designed for educational and demonstration purposes. The system includes functionalities such as creating blocks, mining, adding and removing blocks from the chain, validating the blockchain, and managing transactions between two parties.

### Class Descriptions
- **BlockChainDriver.java**: Main class that runs the blockchain application, handling user inputs and executing commands.
- **BlockChain.java**: Manages the chain of blocks including operations like appending, removing, and validating blocks.
- **Block.java**: Represents an individual block in the blockchain, responsible for storing transaction data and handling block hashing.
- **Hash.java**: Wraps the hash data and provides methods to assess hash validity and perform comparisons.
- **Node.java**: Represents a node in the linked list structure of the blockchain, containing a block and a reference to the next node.
